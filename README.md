# Website Recreation Project Portfolio

## Overview

This project is a recreation of an existing website, specifically the [Rekh Chand Sahu](https://rekhchandsahu.com/) website. The primary purpose of this project is educational; it is intended to study and understand how the original website is constructed. The recreation is done using React, and none of the original code has been copied. All the code in this project has been written by me from scratch.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- **Learn and practice React:** By recreating a fully functional website, I aim to deepen my understanding of React and its ecosystem.
- **Understand modern web design:** Analyzing and replicating a well-designed website helps in learning about layout, design patterns, and best practices in web development.
- **Improve coding skills:** Building a project from scratch reinforces coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Features

- **Minimal Theme:** The recreated website follows the minimalistic design theme of the original.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it works well on various screen sizes.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Leveraging the power of React, the website is built using reusable components.
